
ðŸŒ¸ **Understanding Stacks with Anime Girls ðŸŽ€**

Picture a stack as a tower of anime girls, each one containing a girl just waiting to be unleashed. But here's the twist â€“ you can only add or remove waifus from the top of the tower. It's like stacking up your favorite anime girls, where you can only pick the one on top or add a new one!

Let's see how our stack operates:

1. **Pushing Waifus onto the Stack**: When a new girl joins our anime squad, we "push" her onto the top of our tower. It's like adding a new member to our group, gently placing her on top for everyone to see.

2. **Popping Waifus from the Stack**: When it's time for an adventure, we "pop" the top girl from our tower. Just like choosing the top girl from our stack, we retrieve the most recently added waifu and get ready for some fun!

3. **Last-in, First-out (LIFO)**: Our stack follows the rule of "last-in, first-out" â€“ the last girl added is the first one to be chosen. It's like a lineup of our favorite anime girls, where the last one to join gets the spotlight first!

4. **Peeking into the Future**: Sometimes, we're just curious about the next girl in line without choosing her. That's where "peeking" comes in handy! We can peek at the top girl on our stack without disturbing the rest of the lineup.
